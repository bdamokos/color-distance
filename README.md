# Color Distance Analysis

An interactive tool for analyzing and selecting distinct colors using various algorithms. This tool helps visualize and understand different approaches to maximizing the perceptual distance between colors.

The main point was to demonstrate the diminishing returns of more and more complex algorithms, but still it is a useful tool if one needs a set of distinct colors to display charts, infographics, etc.
